## Steps

### 1. Getting the data
TUBRIC researchers can access their data from XNAT once it is sent there from the scanner. From XNAT, one can download entire scan session for a subject, or individual scans. In this pipeline, we will be downloading the entire scan session. Once a subject's data is downloaded to a local computer, transfer it to the linux machine using rsync or scp.
